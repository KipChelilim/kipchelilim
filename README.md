## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kip Chelilim

I'm a full-stack engineer who gets energized by working through complex problems. I have experience in Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and working with observability tooling. Recently, I built Vispyr, an easy-to-deploy observability tool that automates the setup, configuration, and deployment of a self-hosted observability platform on AWS.

Before working with software, I was a CPA, Finance Transformation Consultant, and Program Manager responsible for designing transformation strategy, managing global remote teams, and delivering executive level reporting.
